## About

**2025:** We are focused on creating a functional website for the University of Auckland Badminton Club. The functional website will comprise a membership process (sign-up, sign-in, sign-out), membership management system, court booking process and more. The website will be built to be user-friendly, aesthetic alongside having an effective and efficient back-end to satisfy the clients.
