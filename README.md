Project initiated by WDCC in 2023.

## About ‚ö°

**2025:** We are focused on creating a functional website for the University of Auckland Badminton Club. The functional website will comprise a membership process (sign-up, sign-in, sign-out), membership management system, court booking process and more. The website will be built to be user-friendly and aesthetic, alongside having an effective and efficient back-end to satisfy the clients.

## Project Structure üèó

This project is set up as a monorepo using [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo), which helps us manage multiple applications and packages efficiently. The project is split into two main applications:

- `apps/frontend`: The Next.js frontend application
- `apps/backend`: The PayloadCMS backend application

Each application has its own deployment pipeline and can be developed independently.

## Setting up the project üíª

### Prerequisites

#### Node.js installation

You will first need to install `Node.js` in order to access the `pnpm` package manager.

**Volta (Recommended)**

It is recommended to use [`Volta`](https://volta.sh/) to manage the Node.js version.

Follow the [instructions](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started) on the website to install it.

**nvm (Node Version Manager)**

However, if you are having problems, or do not want to use `Volta`, a recommended alternative is to use `nvm` to manage the Node.js
version.

- [Windows installation](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)
- [UNIX](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating)

In the root directory, run the following commands to install the correct version of Node.js:

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
```

### Running the project

#### Using pnpm

If you complete one of the above steps, you can then install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
```

To start all applications in development mode:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

To run specific applications:

```bash
# Run only the frontend
pnpm dev --filter=frontend

# Run only the backend
pnpm dev --filter=backend
```

The development servers will be running at:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3001`
- Backend: `http://localhost:3000`

### Keeping a clean codebase

We rely on [Biome](http://biomejs.dev/) to keep the codebase clean and consistent with linting and formatting. [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) and [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) has been installed to setup pre-commit hooks that will automatically format your files when committing. CI tests will run Biome checks to ensure your code has been formatted properly and follows linting rules.

If you want to manually run Biome commands yourself:
```bash
pnpm biome format . # Check formatting
pnpm biome lint .   # Check linting
pnpm biome check .  # Check both
```
You can also add the `--write` flag to these commands to apply fixes to the code.

#### IDE Setup

If you are using `VSCode`, extensions will be recommended to you (namely Biome's VSC plugin). You can [open the extensions panel](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/extensions/extension-marketplace), find the recommended ones and install them. VSC files have already been setup as part of the project to assist with Biome formatting.

Otherwise, you are responsible for figuring out how to configure those plugins in your IDE. (Most IDEs
like [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [Zed](https://zed.dev/) have plugins for these tools built in).

#### Documentation

We recommend usage of the [`JSDoc`](https://jsdoc.app/) syntax to document code. This will help other developers understand the function of code more easily, as names can be misleading.

For example:
```ts
/**
 * Adds two numbers together
 *
 * @param a The first number
 * @param b The second number
 * @returns The sum of the two numbers
 */
export const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b
```

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to store sensitive information that should not be stored in the codebase. Due to our monorepo structure with Turborepo, we have separate environment variable files for different parts of the project:

- Root directory (`.env`): Contains shared environment variables
- `apps/frontend/.env`: Frontend-specific environment variables
- `apps/backend/.env`: Backend-specific environment variables

Each directory has its own `.env.example` file that serves as a template. To set up your environment:

1. Copy each `.env.example` file to `.env` in its respective directory
2. Edit the values according to the keys in each file

For example:
```bash
# Root directory
cp .env.example .env

# Frontend
cp apps/frontend/.env.example apps/frontend/.env

# Backend
cp apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env
```

Then edit each `.env` file with the appropriate values.

### Type Generation

We use Payload's built in code generation to generate types for our project. To do this, you can run the following command:

```bash
pnpm generate:types
```

### Update Type Definitions

To ensure proper type completions for Yamada UI theme tokens in Style Props, we use the Yamada CLI to update type definitions. This process helps maintain accurate TypeScript completions for our customized theme. The script is configured in our package.json to point to our custom theme location.

```bash
pnpm theme
```

This command will process the theme tokens defined in `./src/theme` and generate the necessary theme files.

### Automated Testing

Automated testing is an important part of writing code that can be maintained and understood long after developers
stop working on code.

We use [`vitest`](https://vitest.dev/guide/why.html) as our test runner because of its ease of setup.

Tests should be prefixed with the extension `*.test.ts|x`. For example, `adder.ts` would have a test file called
`adder.test.ts`.

To run all tests, the following command can be used:

```bash
pnpm test
```

To run a single test, you can use the following command:

```bash
# src/app/example-double-admin-count/route.ts can be any file path that points to a test.
# Or you can replace the file path with a pattern (like a file name)
pnpm test src/app/example-double-admin-count/route.test.ts
```

## Tech Stack ‚öô

The project is _mainly_ built around the following technologies:

- [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)
    - Our monorepo build system that helps us manage multiple applications and packages efficiently, enabling faster builds and better dependency management.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
    - Powers our frontend application using the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) architecture. Note that you will need to have some understanding of [React](https://react.dev/learn) to work on this project.
- [PayloadCMS](https://payloadcms.com/)
    - Our backend system that manages content and defines our data structure. This takes away a lot of the hard work that is put into setting up a database and API. You will have to familiarise yourself with how to use Payload's [local API](https://payloadcms.com/docs/local-api/overview).

Additional information is to be documented on the [wiki](https://github.com/UoaWDCC/uabc-web/wiki) for some of the
smaller dependencies

## Deployment üöÄ

The project is deployed in two separate environments:

- Frontend: Deployed on Vercel for optimal Next.js performance
- Backend: Deployed on Railway with MongoDB Atlas for the database

Each deployment has its own CI/CD pipeline and environment configurations. Refer to the deployment documentation in each app's directory for more details.
